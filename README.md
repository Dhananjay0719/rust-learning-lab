# 🦀 Rust Core Concepts

This repository contains small Rust programs that I write while learning and practicing core Rust concepts. The focus is on understanding how Rust works under the hood rather than just writing code that compiles.

## 📚 What you'll find here

- Ownership and move semantics
- Borrowing (`&`) and mutable borrowing (`&mut`)
- `String` vs `&str`
- Mutability and scope rules
- `Option` and `Result`
- Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)
- Common compiler errors and why they happen

Each file is a small experiment meant to clarify one concept at a time.

## ▶️ How to run

```bash
rustc filename.rs
./filename

Or, if using Cargo later:

cargo run
```

## 🎯 Purpose

Learn Rust the right way 🧠

Build a strong foundation for backend and systems programming
